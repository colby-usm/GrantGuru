NCCIH expects that applications to this NOFO will describe the planned future clinical trial and in so doing demonstrate that the proposed (R34) research is scientifically necessary to design or plan the subsequent competitive full-scale clinical trial. Under this R34, the data collected should be used to fill gaps in scientific knowledge necessary to develop a competitive full-scale clinical trial, including, but not limited to the following: examining feasibility and acceptability of interventions lacking published data; tailoring or adapting the content or structure of an intervention to a specific population, modality, or setting; refining the intervention to determine the most appropriate frequency or duration; determining feasibility of recruitment, retention, and data collection procedures; refining and assessing the feasibility of protocolized multi-component interventions; or examining acceptability and adherence of control conditions. The subsequent full-scale clinical trial should have the potential to make a significant impact on public health.
