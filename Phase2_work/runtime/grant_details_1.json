        "synopsisDesc": "The Applied Mathematics program supports mathematics research motivated by and contributing to the solution of problems arising in science and engineering. Successful proposals must demonstrate mathematical innovation, as well as breadth and quality of impact on applications. Projects that additionally provide opportunities for rigorous mathematical training of junior applied mathematicians through their involvement in research are encouraged. The proposals considered by the Applied Mathematics program may range from single investigator to interdisciplinary team projects.\n\n\nConferences\n\n\nProposals to the Applied Mathematics program for conferences or workshops should be submitted through the program solicitation \"Conferences and Workshops in the Mathematical Sciences\" (link below). Principal Investigators should carefully read the program solicitation to obtain important information regarding the substance of proposals for conferences, workshops, summer/winter schools, and similar activities.\n\n\nTo facilitate timely notification of the availability of support:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Proposals for conferences, workshops, etc., to be held in the US must be submitted 8 months in advance of the conference date;</li>\n<li>Proposals to support group travel to meetings outside the US must be submitted 12 months in advance of the meeting date;</li>\n<li>Proposals for conferences, workshops, etc., whose budget request exceeds $50,000 must be submitted during the annual November submission window.</li>\n</ul>",
